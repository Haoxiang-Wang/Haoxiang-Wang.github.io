I am a research scientist at NVIDIA and a core contributor to [Cosmos World Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03575). I obtained my Ph.D. in 2024 from the _Electrical and Computer Engineering_ department at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC), advised by Prof. [Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/) and Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my B.S. in 2019 from UIUC with double majors in (1) Physics, (2) Statistics & Computer Science. 

In the past, I have worked on [multi-task learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09017), [out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12919), [domain adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08200) and [meta-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09137). Besides, I have adapted transformers to solve quantum computing problems in Amazon ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16943)).

Lately, I have been focusing on large language models and multi-modal models, improving their reliability, efficiency, and controllability. Please check out the following paper list for details.
