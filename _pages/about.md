I am a research scientist at NVIDIA and a core contributor to [Cosmos World Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03575). I obtained my Ph.D. in 2024 from the _Electrical and Computer Engineering_ department at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC), advised by Prof. [Han Zhao](https://hanzhaoml.github.io/) and Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my B.S. in 2019 from UIUC with double majors in (1) Physics, (2) Statistics & Computer Science. 

Currently, I am working on [vision-language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15558), [large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18116), and [video generation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03575). My skillset spans pre-training, reinforcement learning, reward modeling, large-scale distributed training, and inference optimization.
